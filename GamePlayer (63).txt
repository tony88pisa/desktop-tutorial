			//Special handling for Vampiirs:
			/* There is no stat that affects the Vampiir's power pool or the damage done by its power based spells.
			 * The Vampiir is not a focus based class like, say, an Enchanter.
			 * The Vampiir is a lot more cut and dried than the typical casting class.
			 * EDIT, 12/13/04 - I was told today that this answer is not entirely accurate.
			 * While there is no stat that affects the damage dealt (in the way that intelligence or piety affects how much damage a more traditional caster can do),
			 * the Vampiir's power pool capacity is intended to be increased as the Vampiir's strength increases.
			 *
			 * This means that strength ONLY affects a Vampiir's mana pool
			 *
			 * http://www.camelotherald.com/more/1913.shtml
			 * Strength affects the amount of damage done by spells in all of the Vampiir's spell lines.
			 * The amount of said affecting was recently increased slightly (fixing a bug), and that minor increase will go live in 1.74 next week.
			 *
			 * Strength ALSO affects the size of the power pool for a Vampiir sort of.
			 * Your INNATE strength (the number of attribute points your character has for strength) has no effect at all.
			 * Extra points added through ITEMS, however, does increase the size of your power pool.
