						 * sitting, standing still (which includes standing in combat mode but
						 * not actively swinging at something), walking, moving backwards,
						 * strafing, or casting a spell. Critical shot will not work against
						 * targets that are: running, in active combat (swinging at something),
						 * or mezzed. Stunned targets may be critical shot once any timers from
						 * active combat have expired if they are not yet free to act; i.e.:
						 * they may not be critical shot until their weapon delay timer has run
						 * out after their last attack, they may be critical shot during the
						 * period between the weapon delay running out and the stun wearing off,
						 * and they may not be critical shot once they have begun swinging again.
						 * If the target was in melee with an archer, the critical shot may not
						 * be drawn against them until after their weapon delay has run out or it
						 * will be interrupted.  This means that the scout's shield stun is much
						 * less effective against large weapon wielders (who have longer weapon
						 * delays) than against fast piercing/thrusting weapon wielders.
